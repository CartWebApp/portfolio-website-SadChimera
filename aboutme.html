        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I love to create art, digital or traditional; additionally, I love to conjure and write up stories and weaving in themes and nuance!
            I love learning about animals, particularly, insects and marine life (as in: jellyfishes, siphonophores, octopi, sea worms, squids, etc.)! I love learning about diseases and their societal impact;
            additionally, I love pretty rocks, gemstones, and jewelry! I am quite interested in psychology and mental health; also interested in law, history, society, and politics! I like playing video games, arts & crafts, 
            I like sleepovers and camping from time to time. I like to nap and read stories to people. I love listening to music and vibing with it.

        <h2>The Post-Secondary Plan</h2>
            <p>I do plan to head to college after I am finished after high-school; whether that be art or programming is still debated. For I have other aspirations within law & order and possibly in the scientific fields.
                I am keeping my options open-minded and flexible, I do aspire to put myself somewhere in groups or communities that value human socialism and cooperation. I still think about going to Gnomon.
