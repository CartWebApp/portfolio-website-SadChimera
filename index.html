            Oh—oh, you forgot who we are celebrating? Come on now, it's Jennifer Lee! She’s the one who joined CART from 2024-2025?
            She draws art and writes in her free time? She coded this entire portfolio! Rumor has it that she’s going to birth a new summer coding/art project after she’s done with WEB! 
            A three-in-one package! Haha, I remember her memo: “I thought I’ll be a cool hacker stressing about not being caught; turns out, I was stressing over the ! TAB button." 
            Anyways lad, have a look around, maybe you could find the visual biography she put for her gracious viewers. Just click the arrows---oh! And don't forget the Lennys. They're important for unlocking the final stage.”</p>

        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>Biography: “Hello, I’m Jennifer Lee, and I came to CART in 2024 for WEB AM before ending in 2025 to pursue Law & Order and Policy AM in 2025-2026. 
            I attend Clovis East High School, and with dreamy eyes, I came here to code with the idea that I was going to be a “pro hacker.” 
            But I learned more than simple movie stereotypes, I learned more than just typing 1s and 0s. I learned that web development is pretty arduous and frustrating at times, but an important skill too. 
            I feel that if I never came into this classroom, I probably would have never become comfortable with wanting to make my own websites and personal projects by myself. 
            I feel as if I would have never got to meet cool people here who are good at what they do if I didn’t go. I feel glad to be here because of new opportunities granted to me and glad of the people that changed my life. 
            There were many hiccups and mistakes I’ve done that I will remedy in the future as I grow more confident, even if it’s slow. 
            I feel proud for wanting to learn something that I know I want to struggle with, but learn continuously, until I am a “professional.” I want to continue to grow alongside the developing world. </p>
