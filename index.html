    Oh—oh, you forgot who we are celebrating? Come on now, it's Jennifer Lee! She’s the one who joined CART from 2024-2025? She coded this entire portfolio! Rumor has it that she’s going to birth a new summer coding/art project after she’s done with WEB! 
    Haha, I remember her memo: “I thought I’ll be a cool hacker stressing about not being caught; turns out, I was stressing over the ! TAB button (still am)." 
    Anyways lad, have a look around, maybe you could find the visual biography she put for her gracious viewers.”</p>
